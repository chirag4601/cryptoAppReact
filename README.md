This repository contains code for the CoinTrackr website (link above), created using React.js with Chakra UI.
This website uses APIs of coin gecko to get exchanges and crypto coins information and uses chart.js and react-chartjs-2 packages to display those graphs.
This website is a personal project.

To run this code, use the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/chirag4601/cryptoAppReact.git

cd cryptoAppReact

npm i 

npm start
